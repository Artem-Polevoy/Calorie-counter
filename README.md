# :sparkles:Calorie-counter:sparkles:
In this project I programmed a one-page application that works in the browser - the calorie counter. The application allows you to calculate individual daily calorie allowance.

### Terms of Reference
- Default state
- The male gender is selected.
- The input field is 0.
- Minimum" physical activity is selected.
- Calculate" button is inactive.
- Button of resetting of the data from input fields is inactive.
- The block with calorie information is hidden.

### The "Calculate" button
- Becomes active only when all input fields are filled in.
- By clicking on the button a block with information about calories appears, if it was not shown before. If the block is already on the page, clicking on the button updates the calculations and displays the current information.

### Button "Clear fields and calculation".
- Becomes active when at least one numeric field is full.
- When you click, all elements of the application are reset to the default state: numeric fields are cleared (placeholder 0), gender becomes male, physical activity is "minimal", and the block with calorie information is hidden.
